# MT2GraftService

A mod for Monster Train 2 that adds an equipment grafting service to most merchants.

# Features

- Allows you to graft an equipment to a unit at most merchants
- The cost of the service is 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 gold for each time it is used
- Because of UI limitations, a merchant can't have more than 4 services so the graft service won't be added if a merchant already has 4 services

# Installation

Install via Thunderstore or manually: copy the mod contents to the 'BepInEx/plugins' folder of your Monster Train 2 installation directory.

# Warning

This is a non-cosmetic mod that changes the game mechanics. Do not use it while playing any online mode as it may cause you to be banned.
